# 4COM2003.circ-T02L1e10
You are given a design board with two 4-bit input pins A and B and
 two output pins: a 4-bit Q and a 1-bit R. Build from gates a circuit that
 computes (A + B) 2 and asserts it on pin Q. The remainder from the
 division should be asserted on pin R. For example, if the input is 4 and
 2, the output should be 3 for Q and 0 for R, and if the input is 5 and
 2, your circuit should assert 4 on Q and 1 on R.
